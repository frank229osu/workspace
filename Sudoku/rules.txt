***Welcome to Sudoku

Here are the rules

1) Each puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid containing given clues in various places.

2) The object is to fill all empty squares so that the numbers 1-9 appear exactly
	once in each row, column, diagonal, & 3x3 box. 

3) The clues given at the start of the game will be contained within curly braces { }.
	These locations cannot be overridden.

4) A player can only overwrite locations indicated by brackets [ ].
	Each location can be overwritten as many times as needed.

5) A victory checker will run after each valid entry and will display,
	"Congrats! You solved the puzzle!" once all victory conditions have been met.

6) Have fun and enjoy!
